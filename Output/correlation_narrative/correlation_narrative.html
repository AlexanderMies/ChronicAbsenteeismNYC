    <h1>NYC Public Schools Absenteeism and its Impact on Test Scores and Demographics</h1>
    <!-- 
    <p>
        [Introduction: Briefly introduce the issue of absenteeism in NYC public schools, its impact on student
        performance, and its connection to demographic disparities.]
    </p>

        Can add heatmap here?
    </p> -->

    <h2>Absenteeism Does Not Help Test Scores</h2>

    <p>
        The relationship between attendance and test score performance is strong. Although attendance and test scores
        are both
        correlated with a host of other variables, a simple correlation analysis shows that the relationship bettween
        the two variables
        is statistically significant. On average, for a percentage point increase in attendance we would expect more
        than a four percentage
        point increase in the percentage of students who scored a 3 or 4 (in the top half) of the math test.

        Clearly, absenteeism is a problem in NYC public schools. Unfortunately, it's also a rising one.
    </p>

            style="display:none;" />
    </div>

    <p id="reg_text1" style="display:none;">
        Assuming the model, \(score = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * attendance\), the estimated regression is
        \(\widehat{score} = -335 + 4.2 * attendance\). The estimated slope is 4.2, which means that for a one percentage
        point
        increase in attendance, we would expect a 4.2 percentage point increase in the percentage of students who
        scored a 3 or 4 (in the top half) of the math test.
        <br>
        The slope coefficient is statistically significant even at strict confidence levels, implying that the
        correlation
        between attendance and test scores is strong. This, however, does not imply causation, as there are many omitted
        yet related variables.

    <h2>Absenteeism is Correlated to Other Variables that Predict Hardship</h2>

    <p>
        <!-- [Section 2: Analyze the relationship between absenteeism and test scores, using data to support your findings.] -->

    </p>

    <p>
        Absenteeism is not a problem that affects all groups equally. It appears to be correlated to other variables
        that tend to predict systemic mistreatment, such as belonging to certain minority groups, lower income groups,
        and (unsurprisingly) chronic absenteeism.

    <p id="reg_text2" style="display:none;">
        When we explore heterogeneity in the relationship between attendance and test scores, we find
        some striking differences.
        <br>
        Districts with a higher percentage of black and hispanic students and districts with a higher percentage of
        students
        in poverty tend to have a smaller percentage of students that achieve level 3 or level 4 (in the top half) on
        the exam.
        Districts with a higher percentage of students with chronic absenteeism, however, tend to have the test scores
        you would
        expect, <em>after controlling for the district's overall attendance</em>.
        <br>
        To see this in the data, we can plot the relationship between score and attendance, giving each group
        it's own intercept term. Plotted above, we estimate the following model for each group:
        <br>
        \[score = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * attendance + \beta_2 * demographic\_variable \]
        <br>
        The estimated regressions are:
        <br>
        \[\widehat{score} = -174 + 2.3 * attendance - 17.8 * black\_hispanic \]
        <br>
        \[\widehat{score} = -234 + 3.0 * attendance - 14.8 * poverty \]
        <br>
        \[\widehat{score} = -319 + 4.0 * attendance - 1.1 * chronic\_absenteeism \]
        <br>
        and we can think of each regression as creating two lines, one for each group. The lines are
        parallel, which means each group is forced to have the same relationship between attendance and score,
        but the intercepts are different, allowing for a different starting point.
        <br>
        The variables <em>black_hispanic</em> and <em>poverty</em> are statistically significant,
        while the variable <em>chronic_absenteeism</em> is not. Note that each of these variables
        is a dummy/binary variable denoting whether or not the district has more students in this
        category than the medium district.

    <br>
    <h2>The Persistent Relationship Between Absenteeism and Test Scores</h2>

    <!-- <p>
        [Section 3: Explore the demographic disparities related to absenteeism, such as differences among race, gender,
        and socioeconomic status.]
    </p> -->

    <p>
        Despite the fact that absenteeism is correlated with other variables that predict hardship, the correlation
        between absenteeism and test scores is consistently strong across groups.
        <br>
        Controlling for a certain group (e.g. districts with a higher rate of poverty), does not seem to change the
        correlation,
        implying that in all districts, higher attendance is correlated with higher performing students.

    <p id="reg_text3" style="display:none;">
        In these regressions, we allow each group to not only have its own intercept, but also its own slope. In
        other words, each group can have a different starting point, and the relationship between attendance and
        score can be different for each group.
        <br>
        We can see the difference in strength of relationship by adding an interaction term between attendance and
        the demographic variable. For one group (the group whose value of the demographic variable is 0), the slope
        (relationship between attendance and score) is simply \(\beta_1\). For the other group (the group whose value
        of the demographic variable is 1), the slope is \(\beta_1 + \beta_3\). The difference between the two
        slopes is \(\beta_3\), and this coefficient's significance tells us whether or not the relationship between
        attendance and score is different for the two groups.
        <br>
        In short, we estimate the following model for each group:
        <br>
        \[score = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * attendance + \beta_2 * demographic\_variable + \beta_3 * attendance *
        demographic\_variable \]
        <br>
        The estimated regressions are:
        <br>
        \[\widehat{score} = -190 + 2.64 * attendance + 44.4 * black\_hispanic - 0.69 * attendance * black\_hispanic \]
        <br>
        \[\widehat{score} = -214 + 2.90 * attendance - 24.3 * poverty + .11 * attendance * black\_hispanic \]
        <br>
        \[\widehat{score} = -547 + 6.47 * attendance + 327 * chronic\_absenteeism - 3.6 * attendance *
        chronic\_absenteeism \]
        <br>
        In these regressions, the coefficients on the binary demographic variables and the interactions terms
        all lose their statistical significance (by including the variable in two terms it's harder for each
        to be significant and for a more thorough analysis we would need to analyze joint significance), except
        for the two terms associated with <em>chronic_absenteeism</em>. This is most clearly seen by the difference
        in slopes in the right-most figure. The steeper slope among districts with relatively low chronic absenteeism
        suggests that each percentage point of attendance correlates more strongly with test scores among districts with
        higher attendance rates. In other words, if you consider a district with initially high attendance that begins
        to slip,
        the first few percentage points lost are most costly than the later ones when the issue has become larger.

    <br>
    <h2>Although Absenteeism is Up, the Relationship Persists Over Time</h2>
    Up until now, we've been looking at data from 2018, 2019, and 2022. The test was redesigned in 2018,
    and in 2020 and 2021 the test was either not administered or not mandatory because of the pandemic.
    <br>
    To see if these findings would be different if we looked at the data by year, we can repeat the above analysis,
    but grouping the data points by year instead of demographic category.
    <br>
    Even though it's clear that absenteeism increased after the pandemic relative to 2018 and 2019 (as shown by
    the 2022 line's placement further left), the relationship between attendance and test scores seems unchanged
    (as shown by the strength of the correlation in each group). Note that because the dependent variable is the
    share of a district's students placing in the top half, this graph does not help with conclusions about whether
    or not overall student test performance is up or down since the start of the pandemic.
