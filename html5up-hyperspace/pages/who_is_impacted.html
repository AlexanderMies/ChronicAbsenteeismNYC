                <p>What neighborhood do you live in? First select your borough, then your neighborhood: </p><br>
                <script src="[DROPDOWN MENUS].js"></script>
                <p>This neighborhood is zoned for District 7:</p><br>   
                <script src="[LINE GRAPH OF ABSENTEEISM FOR DISTRICT 7].js"></script>
                <p>This is the breakdown of District 7 by race:</p><br>   
                <script src="[BREAKDOWN BY RACE].js"></script>
                <p>Absenteeism is correlated with the number of students with disabilities, 
                students in poverty, and English language learners in the district:</p>
                <script src="[3 STATS].js"></script>
                <p>Now, how does District 7 compare to the rest of the NYC school districts?</p><br>
                <script src="[LINE GRAPH OF ALL DISTRICTS].js"></script>
                <p>From the previous visualization, we can see that there was a significant a decrease in the percent of students chronically absent 
                    in the 2019-2020 school year. In the following year, the percent of students chronically absent drastically increased;  
                    however, the magnitude of increase varied widely across districts. In order to understand this heterogenity, 
                    it is important to look at the variables that are correlated with absenteeism. </p><br>
                <p>In the following visualization, we see that demographics played an important role in determining the degree of 
                    increase that districts experienced. In particular, districts with higher percentages of Black and Hispanic students experienced a greater increase. 
                    Further analysis is needed to understand the impact of poverty, disability, and English language learners on school attendance.                    
                </p><br>
