						<h1>Write Up</h1>
						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the NYC public education system. In
							particular, absenteeism (or decreased attendance) has increased in all districts since 2020.
							In this project, we explore if this issue has impacted different areas and groups in New
							York, as well as see how absenteeism affects other variables like academic performance.
							Through interactive data visualizations, we examine heterogeneity in absenteeism across
							racial and socioeconomic groups and present a convincing (and statistically significant)
							negative effect of absenteeism on test score performance in NYC public schools.</p>
						<h2>Related Work</h2>
						<p>Previous research has established that attendance is critical to strong academic performance.
							Also, it was also well-documented in 2020 and 2021 that racial minorities and lower-income
							New Yorkers were hit hardest by the COVID pandemic across a variety of metrics. Our project
							builds on these findings through a simple but compelling narrative that ties absenteeism to
							test performance.</p>
						<h2>Methodology</h2>
						<p>We use data from the New York City Department of Education, which includes attendance rates,
							test scores, poverty rates, and racial/ethnic composition for each school district between
							2018 and 2022. We use data from 2018 onwards to focus on the window before and after the
							COVID pandemic, and to only include data that is easily comparable across time (the
							standardized tests were last redesigned in 2018).
							To convey the main issue at hand–widespread increasing absenteeism–we created an interactive
							choropleth map of NYC. This visual shows an across-the-board increase in absenteeism and
							also hints at unequal effects.
							To emphasize the importance of increasing absenteeism, we explore the relationship between
							attendance and test score performance. We run through a simple linear regression analysis to
							test different components of this relationship, including different effects by demographic
							group. We are cautious about causal claims, but the strong correlations in this section are
							clear–absenteeism is associated with lower test scores. By using the same underlying
							scatterplot in each visual on this page, we hope to reduce the cognitive load needed to
							remember the data, and save the reader’s mental power for understanding the problem.
						</p>
						<h2>Design</h2>
						<p>Our first visualization is an interactive choropleth map of NYC. Created with bokeh, the
							visual shows which districts (represented by darker shading) have faced larger increases in
							absenteeism from 2018 to 2022. Users can hover over the map to see more statistics, like the
							district’s rate of poverty or ethnic composition.
							The second visualization page of scatterplots and regressions, created using seaborn,
							depicts the relationship between test score performance (vertical axis) and attendance rate
							(horizontal axis). The same scatterplot is shown with different groupings (e.g. color
							relates to poverty or color relates to ethnic groups) to rigorously test the relationship
							between scores and attendance. In each subsection, a "Show Regressions" button adds
							regression lines to the same image and provides more curious readers with additional
							quantitative context.
							These visualizations are packaged and displayed in a simple website layout that encourages a
							sequential view but does not restrict readers that want to jump around. We present
							visualizations on individual pages to allow readers to digest one arc at a time, within the
							broader narrative of attendance harming public school students.
						</p>
						<h2>Discussion</h2>
						<p>Our final product demonstrates unequal changes in absenteeism across New York and the
							relationship between attendance and test scores. Users found the interactive elements
							engaging and informative, particularly appreciating the ability to manipulate the scatter
							plots and regression lines. Some users, however, suggested that certain components, like
							viewing the relationship over time, could be shown more clearly through a chronological
							animation, which we implemented via a gif that adds regression lines by year for the
							intertemporal analysis. We also received some feedback that the additional information with
							the regressions was somewhat overwhelming, so we made that text more concise and put the
							“Show/Hide Regressions” button in place (as opposed to moving beyond the extra text), so
							that readers could more easily switch between the two modes. </p>
						<h2>Future Work</h2>
						<p>To expand our project, we would explore additional data sources to include factors like
							school resources, teacher qualifications, and parental involvement. We would also be
							interested to test our findings and see if they hold up under a microdata-driven analysis,
							as opposed to merely at the district level. Another area we’d like to explore is the effect
							of access to public transport on absenteeism and academic achievement.</p>
						<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
						<p>We would like to thank our TAs, professor, and classmates for their invaluable feedback
							throughout the development of this project.</p>
